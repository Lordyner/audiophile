## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add/Remove products from the cart
- Edit product quantities in the cart
- Fill in all fields in the checkout
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
  - Shipping always adds $50 to the order
  - VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
- **Bonus**: Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Shopify] (https://www.shopify.com/fr)

### What I learned

- How to use Shopify Graph QL API
- How to request Graph QL API
- How to create a store on Shopify and create meta fields

### Continued development

I have some improvements in mind for this project : 
- Refactor my project and have a clean architecture
- Call Shopify API to handle cart (for the moment I handle cart on my own)

In general those are the two aspects I want to keep working on : architecture and building e-commerce app with Shopify
